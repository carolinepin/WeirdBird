thank you to Game Maker's Toolkit for such an amazing and educational video

To play my silly little game, download the code as a zip file, decompress it on your computer, then click the "firstgame.exe". Hopefully it runs??? Warning, their is no menu to close the game, just Ctrl+Alt+Tab and close the unity window :)
