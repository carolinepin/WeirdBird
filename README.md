thank you to Game Maker's Toolkit for such an amazing and educational video

To play my silly little game, download the code as a zip file, decompress it on your computer, then click the "firstgame.exe". Hopefully it runs??? Warning, their is no menu to close the game, just Ctrl+Alt+Tab and close the unity window :)

ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. Don't click the "firstgame.exe" in the "WeirdBird.main" directory. you NEED to click the "firstgame" folder, then click the "built" folder, then click the "firstgame.exe" from there. I can't find out how to delete it on my gitHub folders. I'll try to fix it but honestly this has taught me a lot in the way of files are a nightmare and I need to play in advance if I want to share a unity game to gitHub.
Also, your computer might say the game is "unsafe", just click "more info" then RUN ANYWAY. It's not a virus I swear. I promise. Totally not a virus, would a virus creator warn you it's not a virus? I don't think so.
If you are my friend who I linked to this repository, vouch for me in the comments. Remember to like comment and subscribe to your favorite youtuber.
